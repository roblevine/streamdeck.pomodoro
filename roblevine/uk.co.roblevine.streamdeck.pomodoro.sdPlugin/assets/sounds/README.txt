This folder contains the reset feedback sound asset.

Auto-generation:
- On build, a CC0 double-pip WAV may be generated at
  "reset-double-pip.wav" if the file does not already exist.

Override (optional):
- You may replace the file with your own WAV (PCM), very short (~200â€“500 ms)
  double-pip cue. Ensure the license permits redistribution with the plugin.

If absent and not generated, the plugin will silently skip the reset sound.
